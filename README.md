# AgenticAI

This implementation makes use different `Autogen` modules and tools to leverage search, multimodal understanding and Vision Capabilities to make use of images obtained on the fly.

I used Azure OpenAI endpoints for LLM.

**Current implementation succeeds to execute the playwright code on the fly to open browsers but struggles to log into websites to perform the tasks as desired (as seen in the demonstration). I did this last summer at my first internship as part of a research initiative.**
